# Try to connect React & Redux app to API

## Learning objectives

- Connect an existing API via Redux and use the data to display something in a UI.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

This exercise will help you learn how to **connect async logic to interact with a Redux store** when fetching data from an external API.

_IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise._

### Instructions

You will be working with the following external API: [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5).

1. Create a new React application using Create React App
2. Install `@reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`
3. Create a new Redux store and connect it to your React application
   - Use `configureStore` and pass it an object with a `reducer`, which should take `users` reducer
   - Export your store as default
   - Import and wrap `<Provider>` in your top-level component and inject your `store`
4. Create a new slice of state in `src/store/users/usersSlice.js`
   - Use `createSlice` and define:
     - `name` as a string
     - `initialState`, which includes `users` as an array, `isLoading` as a boolean and `error` as undefined
     - `extraReducers` as an empty object
   - Export your reducer from your slice
   - Export the slice itself as default
   - Import the `usersSlice` into your store and assign it to your `reducer` object
5. Create a new component that will contain your fetched users:
   - Import `useSelector` and destructure your `users`, `isLoading` and `error` from your users state
   - Add a loading state; JSX content that shows when `isLoading` is true
   - Add an error state; JSX content that shows when `error` has received new content
   - Add a default state that maps over your `users` inside of an unordered list:
     - Add a `key` to the container element.
     - Render the first and last name of the user

**At this stage, you should have successfully implemented Redux Toolkit! If not, please go back to the previous steps**

6. Inside of `src/users/usersSlice.js`, create an action creator that fetches your users:
   - Import `createAsyncThunk` and instantiate it in a new variable
   - Pass your action creator 2 arguments: an action type and an asynchronous function (use the [documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk))
   - Write your fetching logic inside of a `try/catch` block:
     - In the `try` block, return your fetched data
     - In the `catch` block, pass your error to the `rejectWithValue`
7. Inside of your `userSlice` variable, modify the `extraReducers`:
   - Replace the empty object with a function that takes 1 argument, `builder`
   - Add 3 cases with `addCase`, which takes 2 arguments: an action type and a reducer function
     - In the pending state, mutate the `isLoading` state to true
     - In the fulfilled state, mutate the `isLoading` state to false and assign the payload to the `users` state
     - In the rejected state, mutate the `isLoading` state to false and assign an error message to the `error` state
8. Back in your new component, add the following changes:
   - Import `useDispatch` and instantiate it inside of a variable within the component
   - Import `useEffect` and pass it 2 arguments: an empty function and an empty dependency array
   - Import your action creator and dispatch it inside of your `useEffect`. Be sure to add the action creator to the dependency array
9. Test to see if everything works. You should now have a working application!
